## Overview
This is an Image Classification project which classifies wild animals (4-classes) using famous Transfer Learning technique vgg-16.

## Motivation
Learning Data science is not enough , showing what you have learned will make a difference. This pandemic helped me in learning data science and also this is my first Transfer Learning project.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
